Volkswagen will enter the market at the end of the year with the ID at a price level Tesla can't compete with. Even when Volkswagen isn't efficient like a Model 3, this Golf class vehicle will come with a lower price on the market and with a comparable range. Volkswagen has streamlined the production of EV to penetrate the markets as fast as possible.  Btw.

88,rargghh,,,[],,,,text,t2_4xw72mn,False,"Yes.  It is cyclical and beaten down now with DRAM/NAND prices falling.  But the cycle is definitely shorter.  Memory is essential to everything tech, especially fast memory.  MU operations in an oligopoly with Samsung and SK Hynix.  They have been behaving rationally, keeping supply at a level that meets demand so they can maintain margins.  Micron now has the best margins of the bunch.  It is also the only US company (which is a big deal for cyber security).  I believe MU also has the patents for Chalcogenide RAM logic.  C-RAM is used in space. They had a joint venture with Intel to develop Xpoint.   This is an interesting development and could be a step toward programming in memory.

Currently, the bottleneck of computing isn't in processors but in memory.  Moving data in and out of memory to perform processes crushes speed.  If we don't change the way we program, this will always occur, so MU has longevity.  If MU solves this problem and creates something that allows processing to happen in memory, they will be rich as fuck.  

2 huge memory eaters are AI and data centers.  AI is in its infancy and data centers are still expanding.  

Memory chips also go in computers, cellphones, basically everything in the internet of things, autonomous cars, any product labeled 'smart', servers, whatever basically everything in tech

MU stock will rise before the bottom of prices is found, the market is forward looking.  I'm really surprised no one has made a bid to buy them out.  It's not a question of if MU's stock price will break 100 but when.  They also have a $10B stock buyback budget and if they've been accumulating during this last down cycle, they'll end up buying back 1/4 to 1/3 of their market cap.  

XPoint and capex in Manassas are reason enough for me to be buying MU.  The margins, increased demand, oligopoly, and buybacks are sweet icing on the cake.  Also any news of this trade war with China getting resolved, MU explodes.

Micron's next earnings is 3/20. I expect it to shoot 10% either way.  MU has been described as the most hated stock on wall street.  The market just doesn't give a fuck about it or know how to treat it.

Big money manipulates the hell out of it.  6/30-9/30/18 Morgan Stanley downgraded it continuously.  During that time, they increased their holdings from 5.3M shares to 11.9M.  I suspect they've been bashing it these last 5 months to buy as much as they can.  MU has a poison pill that no one can own more than 5%.  

Full disclosure: I have 100% of my IRA MU and am holding Jan 2020 60, 62.5, and 80 calls in my trading account.  All my money is in MU.  

If it drops below 40, buy as much as you can.  It may not drop below 40 again though.  I think anything below $50 is a great price.
